# chatrbox

## Description

A fullstack chat application built with the MERN stack. The app employs user authentication and creation and uses SocketIO for real-time chatting amongst users.

I opted to use Redux Toolkit and quite enjoyed it for the purposes of this application. It makes a lot of sense for an application of this size as it streamlines a lot of the classic Redux setup patterns I've grown accustomed to.

- MongoDB
- Express
- SocketIO
- Reactjs
- NodeJS
- Redux (Redux Toolkit)
